## Systemless Xposed For SDK 25 (Android 7.1)
### Please install my modified [XposedInstaller](https://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=4297539&d=1507562905) to properly detect Systemless Xposed

The APK is signed by my personal key, you might need to uninstall other versions before installing mine.

Note for Samsung users: if your device is still on SDK 22 or 23, please use v87.3 from the support thread, **v88+ will not work on these old Samsung devices!**
